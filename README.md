This is a fork of the read-only SVN head for improvements and bug fixes. For background, see the following posts on OSQA meta:

* http://meta.osqa.net/questions/11580/is-anyone-interested-in-testing-experimental-endless-pagingpjax-loading

**NOTE**: Until a proper master Git repository is available for OSQA, I may need to rewrite history on this repository. Feel free to clone, but understand you may need to either force pull or merge later.
